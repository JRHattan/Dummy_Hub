# Hypothesis
    By using analyzed data provided from Lending Club, are we able to possible to predict what loans will be successful versus loans that will fail?

## Reasons for Project
    This sort of program would be beneficial to Loan Lenders insuring that their money would produce a return and not end up costing them money.

### Resource
    All of the data comes from a CSV file from Lending Club which can be found on Kaggle.com  
	    The data presented comes from the collection of information such as:
		    Fully paid
		    Current
		    In Grace Period
		    Late (16-30)
		    Late (30-120)
		    Charged off 
		
#### Questions

    What factors constitutes a successful loan versus a risky loan
	    Does the time at which a payment is done determine the outcome of a loan
	    Does the amount of a payment indicate the successfulness of the loan
	    Do  delinquents alter the amount of successful versus not being successful
	    What step of a loan is important for predicting the outcome of a loan

	    What information should be defined for the machine learning
		    What are the dependent variable versus the independent variable based off of the filtered loan data
    Do we need to have more than one independent variable to compare against the one dependent variable
