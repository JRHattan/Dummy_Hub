# Classification Machine Learning Models for credit decisions



## Analysis Project
We decided to analyze loan data to build classification supervised machine learning models that predict good and bad loans with high accuracy.

We felt that working with loan data and credit decision predictions would not only be very interesting, as it is widely used across lending institutions, but also a very useful exercise. 

We use a dataset of Lending Club loan data spanning over 10 years.  The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle, as Lending Club no longer makes its loan data available to the general public as they did until recently.  Our dataset contains over 2.2 million rows of data, representing loan recipients and 151 columns of data pertaining to the loans. 

### Questions we hope to answer through this project

* Can we build machine learning models that predict good and bad loans with high accuracy?
* Which factors (variables) contribute the most helpful information to the machine learning model?
* Which type of machine learning model is best suited for this task?
* Which optimization methods best help optimize the accuracy of machine learning models for this type of dataset?

## Database
 
Team members present a fully integrated database. 
✓ Database stores static data for use during the project 
✓ Database interfaces with the project in some format (e.g., scraping updates the database, or database connects to the model) 
✓ Includes at least two tables (or collections, if using MongoDB) 
✓ Includes at least one join using the database language (not including any joins in Pandas) 
✓ Includes at least one connection string (using SQLAlchemy or PyMongo) 
Note: If you use a SQL database, you must provide your ERD with relationships.

## README.md must include: 
✓ Description of the communication protocols 
✓ Outline of the project (this may include images, but should be easy to follow and digest) Note: The descriptions and explanations required in all other project deliverables should also be in your README.md as part of your outline, unless otherwise noted.

Individual Branches 
✓ At least one branch for each team member 
✓ Each team member has at least four commits for the duration of the second segment (eight total commits per person)





## Dashboard
A blueprint for the dashboard is created and includes all of the following: 
✓ Storyboard on Google Slide(s) 
✓ Description of the tool(s) that will be used to create final dashboard 
✓ Description of interactive element(s)
